# 🐢 Turtle Crossing – OOP Mini Project

This is a simple Python game built with the `turtle` module to **practice and consolidate Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** concepts.

The goal of the game is to move the turtle across the screen while avoiding moving cars. As you cross successfully, the level increases and the car speed accelerates.

## 🚀 How to Run

This project is **fully functional** and can be run immediately by executing the main file:

```bash
python main.py
```

Make sure you have Python 3 installed and the `turtle` module available (included in standard library).
